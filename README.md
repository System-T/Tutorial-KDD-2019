## Abstract

With the proliferation of information in unstructured and semi-structured form, text understanding (TU) is becoming a fundamental building block in enterprise applications. SystemT is an industrial-strength system for developing end-to-end TU applications in a declarative fashion. Commonly used text operations are abstracted as built-in operators with clean, well-specified semantics exposed through a formal declarative language called AQL (Annotation Query Language), which are transformed by a compiler into highly optimized internal implementations and executed by an efficient and lean runtime engine. Its architecture is designed to address the main requirements for enterprise TU: scalability, expressivity, transparency, and extensibility. SystemT today ships with multiple products across 4 IBM Software Brands and is used in multiple ongoing research projects and being taught in universities. Ongoing research and development efforts focus on making SystemT more usable for both technical and business users, and continuing enhancing its core functionalities based on natural language processing, machine learning, and database technology. 

In this tutorial, we will motivate declarative TU and showcase SystemT features for meeting the enterprise TU requirements. The hands-on labs will provide concrete examples on performing TU in progressively sophisticated use cases.
